# Dimensional Data Modeling with PostgreSQL

Welcome to my repository dedicated to learning and implementing **Dimensional Data Modeling** using PostgreSQL. This project showcases concepts like **cumulative table design**, **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)**, and other advanced data modeling techniques for analytical systems.

## ðŸŒŸ Features

- **Cumulative Tables**
  - Designing and querying cumulative summary tables for aggregated metrics.
- **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)**
  - Support for SCD Type 1, Type 2, and Type 3 with examples.
- **PostgreSQL-Specific Features**
  - Use of native PostgreSQL features like arrays, enums, and advanced SQL functions.
- **Data Loading & Transformation**
  - Scripts for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
  - Use of common table expressions (CTEs) for data transformations.
